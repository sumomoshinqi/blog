![:)](/images/Avatar.jpg)    

My name is _李秦琦_ (Lǐ Qín Qí). I also use *Edam Lee* as English name, so you can just call me *Edam* if you don’t know how to say my Chinese name. I use the ID *_sumomoshinqi_* when on the internet. This word was initally random generated. It feels, however somewhat geeky so I decided to use it as an alias. 

I was born in [Yangzhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou) and am now living in [Shanghai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai) studying computer science at [Fudan University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University).  

I'm an enthusiastic developer and familiar with *nix platforms. While doing independent development, I’m also doing research about computer vision.

I speak Mandarin, English and  Japanese. Lover of animes and rhythm games<del>, also a master of cooking</del>.  

You can get in touch with me using any of the methods on the sidebar. Or just send your message via *i AT qinqi.li*.
