My name is _李秦琦_ (Lǐ Qín Qí). I also use *Edam Lee* as English name, so you can just call me *Edam* if you don’t know how to say my Chinese name. I use the ID *_sumomoshinqi_* when on the internet. This word was initally random generated. It feels, however somewhat geeky so I decided to use it as a screen name. 

I was born in [Yangzhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou) and am now living in [Shanghai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai) studying computer science at [Fudan University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University).  

As a developer, I use multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Obj-C, C#, Bash. I do most stuffs on my Mac and am familiar with Unix/Linux platform. While doing independent development, I’m a beginner of computer vision reseacher.  

I speak Mandarin, English and limited Japanese. Lover of animes and rhythm games<del>, also a master of cooking</del>.  

You can get in touch with me using any of the methods on the sidebar. Or just send your message to edam.lqq AT gmail.com. I use this account for instant messaging services like iMessage, WhatsApp and Viber as well.
